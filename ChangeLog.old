* hilight_ratio is deprecated, use highlight_ratio instead, which is 1.1 by default and 1.0 for a flat look (previously was 0.909090)
Anyway a dummy parse is still present, so hilight_ratio will continue to work but it will print warnings.

* Rounded frames
* A lot of improvements in the code, much more clean
* Added toolbarstyle with three styles: toolbarstyle= 0 flat, toolbarstyle = 1 glassy, toolbarstyle = 2 gradient
* Added sliderstyle = 1 (from email [Murrine Improvement] "sliders style options" by Andrea Antolini) to add handles on sliders
* Automatically colorize scrollbar with bg[SELECTED], a new option "colorize_scrollbar = TRUE | FALSE" is used to colorize it or no
* Added new default button state
* Glossy tooltips
* New arrows

===
* New option, hilight_ratio = 1.0 (it's a double) to select the amount of hilight you want. Useful with dark themes that lacks on hilight (set hilight_ratio = 1.15 or more) or you can simply decrease the hilight (set hilight_ratio = 0.909090 to have a flat theme!!! Less to emulate something similar to the concave style, useful to make concave style on rounded themes)

* Fixed a rendering bug on scrollbar steppers
* Added retrocompatibility to old themes before 0.30 release
* Now arrows on comboboxes and optionmenus use text color (good for dark themes)
